                Howlite is a great stone to reduce anxiety, tensions, stress and anger, it is gentle, 
                soothing and calms the energy around you. Red is associated with the base chakra, support,
                 energy and basic survival instincts. Red Howlite is one of the “attunement stones” which 
                 link the user to higher spiritual consciousness.

                It has a hugely calming influence helping to slow an over active mind, and in turn this can 
                help to achieve a deep and restful sleep.  Howlite can help to access higher wisdoms during 
                the dream state and bring it back into consciousness when awaking.
