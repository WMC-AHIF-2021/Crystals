        <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>
                The red jasper stone comes from many places around the world, including Brazil, 
                France, Germany, India, Russia, and the United States. You see them in cracks 
                and veins of volcanic rocks and, interestingly, no one has ever seen jasper 
                geodes that look like agate ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Red Jasper invites you to keep your focus and strength regardless of whatever 
                task you are doing, especially during times of stress. For those who feel as though 
                their mind and energy can flit out of focus, Red Jasper can bring you back. It is an 
                exceptional tool for using as part of your meditation practice as alongside inviting 
                endurance in difficult situations it has strong spiritual properties too.
