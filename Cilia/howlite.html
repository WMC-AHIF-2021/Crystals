                Howlite has a porous texture and is also known as Magnesite. Its color scheme 
                is chalky white with dark veins but it can also be colorless. The meaning of 
                Howlite is linked to patience and perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
                Howlite can help you achieve peace and calm while keeping you attuned to your pure and infinite energies.
                Howlite is a stone of emotional healing that contains vibrations directly resonating with oneâ€™s root and 
                crown chakras. This is a unique combination, with Howlite opening up portals of entry on opposite points of
                 the etheric body. Your root chakra becomes fully connected to Mother Earth and all the energy she provides, 
                 while staying in direct contact with your higher self.
