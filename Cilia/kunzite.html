                It’s sometimes known as The Woman’s Stone because it helps 
                young mothers who are having a tough time taking care of their young child.
                It’s a pretty effective stone that will help overactive children settle down 
                come bedtime, and the stone’s energies will also help young children have 
                a good night’s sleep. Kunzite will bring you inner peace and give you a high 
                capacity for achieving wisdom and understanding.
                It will calm all the noise and chaos in your life, and you will enjoy peace 
                and serenity whenever you need it.
