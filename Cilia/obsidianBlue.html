        <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>
                The Blue Obsidian stone is created by volcanic lava with high silica content and 
                trapped gas bubbles that cool quickly before crystals form. So it cannot be considered 
                as a crystal. Crystals are usually other forms of volcanic matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blue Obsidian has a unique energy that radiates cool-headed clarity,
                a sense of calmness, and the splendor of grounded and courageous communication.
                Blue Obsidian is all about neutralizing and balancing which is why it's so good 
                at encouraging communication and grounding. This also works when it comes to the 
                body as it invites your whole system to chill out, strengthen, and stay solid in ticking over.
                One of the major strengths of Blue Obsidian comes in its ability to help with communication skills.
