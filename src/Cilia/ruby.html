            <p>
                The finest rubies come from Burma (Myanmar). They are also mined in Afghanistan,

                The ruby is an excellent stone that helps you recharge your dropping energy levels and 
                induces positive thoughts in your mind. Aptly named the King of Gemstones, this precious 
                stone represents the Sun and is known to impart good health and mental strength to the wearer.
                They overcome exhaustion and calm hyperactivity. They detoxify the body and blood, and treat fevers,
                diseases, and restricted blood flow.
