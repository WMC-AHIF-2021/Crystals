        <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>
                Today the most common source of Malachite comes from Africa.

            <p>
                Malachite is the essence of joy and is known as the "stone of 
                transformation" because it helps reveal and heal emotional pain 
                by absorbing the pain into itself. It is especially helpful in 
                bringing ease during times of change and gives the insight needed 
                for personal growth. Itâ€™s a stone known to keep blood pressure on
                 the down low and its calming nature certainly helps this. 
                 Malachite also works in harmony with the bones.
