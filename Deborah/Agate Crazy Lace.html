        <p>
            The Crazy Lace Agate is a hapiness stone, which is only found in Chihuahua in Mexico. It usually 
            has complex patterns and bright colors, producing swirls of golds, greys, blacks, and browns, and even the occasional reds and pinks.
            The stone also known as Happy Lace, is quite young compared to other minerals that can be found on Earth.
            Its energies are strong, yet soothing and energizing. It can bring your own energy to a more grounded and attuned frequency.
            The Crazy Lace Agate will show you how to stay present in the moment. No matter how much you've got going in your life right now,
            you will always be able to enjoy the precious little moments.
